1) How well the partnership worked:
    The pair programming technique worked very well between us, my partner have been very helpful and informative during the procedure.

2) Which techniques worked well, which did not:
    The technique of switching every 30 min worked very well, this allowed us to have a clear structure of the project, making us writing less buggy code.
    And I think that all the techniques are very helpful when we make critical decision.
